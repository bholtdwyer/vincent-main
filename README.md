Personal Academic Website. 

Note to self on deploying website:

Website is managed through Github. Add or update files locally, then git add or update, git commit, and git push origin master. Will then automatically rebuild on netlify.

Main page is governed by public/index.html. Other content is for whatever reason by folders under "content".
