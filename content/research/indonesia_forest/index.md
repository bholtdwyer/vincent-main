title: "Whose Woods are These? 'Maintained' Forest Enforcement in Indonesia"
---

In this paper I investigate the effectiveness of enforcement of Indonesia's Maintained Forest, a vast area under the control of the central government that is supposed to be maintained as forest in perpetuity. Using a geographic RD design, I find that there are only small de facto effects of this de jure protected status. Most of the small protective effect appears to operate through restrictions on tree crops, a major source of deforestation (and also local economic development) in Indonesia.
