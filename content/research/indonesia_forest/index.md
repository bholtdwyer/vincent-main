title: "Whose Woods are These? State Forest Enforcement in Indonesia"
---

In this paper I investigate the effectiveness of enforcement of Indonesia's Maintained Forest, a vast area under the control of the central government that is supposed to be maintained as forest in perpetuity. I find that there are only small de facto effects of this de jure protected status, and that most of the protection appears to operate through restrictions on tree crops, a major source of deforestation in Indonesia.
