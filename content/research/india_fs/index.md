title: "Farming on the Margin: the Green Revolution and Farm Sizes in India"
---

I investigate the impact of the Green Revolution on the farm size distribution in India. Employing an instrument for the adoption of new high-yielding varieties of staple crops, I find that adoption of high-yielding crop varieties led to increased concentration of farms and farmland in the smallest size category, with no effects on large farms. This contrasts with the predictions of existing models of the farm size distribution, in which an increase in farmland productivity puts downward pressure on sizes across the full range of the distribution. Instead, it suggests that the interaction of inheritance norms with poorly functioning land markets creates a situation in which the farmers on the margin between agriculture and non-agriculture are those managing the smallest farms, and in which their entry and exit decisions do not have effects further up the farm size distribution.
