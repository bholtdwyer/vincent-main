  My name is Brendan Holt Dwyer (I go by "Holt"), and I am currently a PhD candidate in Economics at UC San Diego. I grew up in New Jersey, studied economics (major) and computer science (minor) at Princeton University, and worked as a research assistant at the Federal Reserve Board (Financial Stability) prior to starting my Ph.D.

  I am interested in issues of structural transformation and agriculture in developing countries, with experience working on India and Indonesia. I also study U.S. macro, in particular the effects of federal procurement spending on firm growth.
