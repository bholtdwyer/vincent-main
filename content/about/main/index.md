  My name is Brendan Holt Dwyer (I go by "Holt"), and I am currently a PhD candidate in Economics at UC San Diego.
  I hold a BA in Economics from Princeton University; prior to graduate school I was an RA at the Federal Reserve Board (Financial Stability division).
  I am interested in issues of structural transformation and agriculture in developing countries, with experience working on India and Indonesia. I also study U.S. macro, in particular the effects of federal procurement spending on firm growth.
